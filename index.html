    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Art-A boon</h2>
    <p><h3 style=color:white>Placing myself in one art genre can be challenging. I’m still not quite sure where I stand in art world. I have recently come to realize that I should major in art. I enjoy few ways of creating art. One is by sketching something or someone, which I usually don’t finish. Second way is by creating still life, by painting, sketching, or just drawing. Lastly, creating portraits, usually by sketch and sometimes by painting. I enjoy sketching a lot. Some may see sketching as one way to help create a real art but in reality sketching also could be a finished artwork. Sketch artists can look at a subject and draw it as close as possible to the original on paper or another similar surface. They must have great hand-eye coordination, artistic talent, steady hands and the ability to make realistic drawings. Sure any art needs these techniques but sketching is all based on these techniques and nothing more.</h3></p>        
    <p><h3 style=color:white>I do sketching because it is a fast and loosely drawn work, so I can draw in school when everything or everyone around is moving constantly. I usually never finish if im drawing a person. When I draw my family member I take more time to add shadings and lighting and define more structures. In that case my art looks more like a finished art. A black and white portrait.</h3></p>
            <p><h3 style=color:white> Historically, portrait paintings have primarily memorialized the rich and powerful. One of best-known portraits in the Western world is Leonardo da Vinci‘s painting titled Mona Lisa, named for Lisa del Giocondo,a member of the Gherardini family of Florence and Tuscany and the wife of wealthy Florentine silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo. Over time, however, portraits became more common for middle-class patrons to commission portraits of their families and colleagues. Today, portraits are very common way of interacting with art for people not interested in art.</h3></p     
                <p><h3 style=color:white>Sketching helps develop a number of different areas of your brain. You develop your ability to focus and pay attention, a skill that can be very useful throughout your life and career. It also develops hand-eye coordination so that everyday tasks can become easier for you. But it also develops strategic thinking, something which everyone needs to be able to do some amount of.</h3></p>
            <p><h3 style=color:white>Rest and relaxation is one of the main advantages of sketching, as a hobby. Sketching allows you to sit back and sketch a picture at your own pace. There are no rules and no one telling you what to do, you can just draw whatever you want and have fun while doing it</h3></p>
                <p><h3 style=color:white>Sketching can also help you improve your communication skills. Because there are no words in a drawing, well, most of the time, the artist finds other ways to communicate with the audience. This can help you improve your other communication skills by better understanding your feelings and emotions and without the need for words to be spoken.</h3></p>
